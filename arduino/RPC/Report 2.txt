module 1 Serial ipt
Approach 1 optimised for noob use

read in put charecter by charecter // only way of nitifying signal reception complete is by fixing a RPC size

approach2 for api use
make send data type functions and recieve data type functions to minimise over head 

module 1 potential future USB bulk /  isochronus

module 2 handler

approach 1 hander FLAGS modify isr and check for flag variable config

if running check for end flag 
modify isr to toggle flag when it recieves a certain flag charecter
else in main check loop 


module 3  cool add ons
 time out check time fnuction

/*	Problems / sols / Comments / misc
// Looks like all the buffers and counters in the serial library are protected and hence cant be accessed without modifying the librbray
// work around by either modifying the isr or by adding a last read/ flag variable
// Suggest writing new isr and making a new arduino uno - cyclops board config file
